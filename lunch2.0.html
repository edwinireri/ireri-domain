                <li>Preparations;
                    <li>In a suitable clean pan you’re using to cook the pilau, add the salad oil and place it on the fire. Let the oil get hot; not smoking hot.</li>
                    <li>Add the onion and fry to a golden color. Stir frequently.</li>
                    <li>Add the garlic, ginger, and fresh turmeric. If you’re using turmeric powder, wait and add it with the pilau masala spice later. Keep stirring until the entire mixture turns a dark golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Add the tomato at this point. Stir a little, cover, and significantly lower the heat. Let the mixture simmer for a minute or two.</li>
                    <li>Stir in the tomato paste, 2 tablespoons of dhania, and the green pepper.
                        Add the pilau masala and the salt and evenly stir the mixture.
                        Cover again for a minute, still on low heat, to allow the ingredients to blend well together.</li>
                    <li>Next, stir in the rice and continue stirring until all the ingredients are evenly blended together.
                        Pour in the hot water and stir the mixture. Bring it to a boil.
                        Cover the pan and significantly lower the heat. Let the rice cook on this very low heat for about 20 minutes or until most of the water in the rice is gone.
                        </li>
                    <li>Use a fork to gently turn the rice, allowing the ingredients to mix into the rice evenly, now that they tend to collect at the top.</li>
                    <li>Cover again and let the rice cook for another 10 or so minutes.</li>
                    <li>Gently turn your rice again with a fork then cover. Give it another 10 minutes or until the rice is ready.
                        Garnish with the remaining dhania (coriander) and, or any other suitable garnish.</li>
