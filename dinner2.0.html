    <h1>2. Nyama choma</h1>
    <p>Preperations;
        <ul>
            <li>Ingredients <br>
                <li>Meat: this recipe uses a whole bone-in goat leg but works well with spare ribs, pork, chicken (Kuku choma), 
                    beef, mutton, or lamb. Adjust cooking times based on the meat type to avoid overcooking.
                   </li>
                   <li>Vegetables: fresh ginger, garlic, onion and, bird eye chillis (optional).</li>
                   <li>Spices: cumin, paprika, and stock cubes.</li>
                   <li>Fruit: lemon juice (easily substitutable with lime juice).</li>
                  <li> Condiments/other: honey, cooking oil, paprika powder, and salt.</li></li>
                  <li>Steps;
                    <li>For the nyama choma marinade, blend all ingredients (except the meat) until smooth. If you lack a blender, dice everything finely or use a pestle and mortar. Marinating the meat is an extra step, but it's worth it as it enhances the flavors.</li>
                    <li>On a chopping board, make 2-inch (5 cm) slits on the meat.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, coat the meat with the marinade, ensuring the slits are covered. Save some marinade for basting during grilling.</li>
                    <li>Cover the meat and allow it to marinate for at least two hours or overnight, for best results .</li>
                    <li>Bring meat to room temperature. Preheat the grill to high; if using charcoal, adjust the heat using the ashes.</li>
                    <li>Sear meat for 3 minutes per side to get char marks. Place on oiled foil and top with the reserved marinade. Add garlic and rosemary on top, then cover losely with foil.</li>
                    <li>Set meat on a water-filled tray and grill under medium-low heat.</li>
                    <li>As an optional step, near the end, mix honey and hot water and glaze the meat with it. Continue grilling until cooked through, and the juices run clear.</li>
                    <li>Let the meat rest for 10-20 minutes and then serve.</li>
                  </li> 
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h1>3. Chapaiis</h1>
    <p>Preperations;
        <ul>
                <li> Make sure the water is warm and stir the salt into it to dissolve.</li>
                <li>Make a well in the middle of the flour and pour in the salted water, knead for about 2-3 minutes (it will be sticky but do not add any flour). Cover the dough with cling film and leave to rest for 2 hours.</li>
                <li>Portion the dough into 6 balls, cover, and begin by rolling each one as thin as you can get it (without caring about the shape at this phase). Then drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil/ghee evenly across it, and a somewhat generous pinch of flour evenly across it before rolling and twirling it onto itself.</li>
               <li> Heat the pan (medium heat) as you roll out the dough balls. Do not roll them too thin (otherwise, they will be tough).</li>
            <li>Place the chapati on the pan without oil and let it cook until it changes color on the top then flip it over and as the bottom cooks you can now add oil to the top. Flip it over again and add some oil to the now top then flip it back (so each side has been cooked twice). Each chapati should cook for at least 3 minutes and not more otherwise it will dry out. </li>
            <li>And thatâ€™s it! Store in an airtight container to retain moisture.</li>
        </ul>
