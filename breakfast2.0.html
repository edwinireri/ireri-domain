        <li>Fold and serve: Fold the omelette in half. Slide it onto a plate with the help of a silicone spatula.</li>

    <p>steps
        <ol>
            <li>Gather ingredients;
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups of warm water.</li>
                    <li>2 tsp. baking powder.</li>
                    <li>4 cups all-purpose flour.</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup sugar.</li>
                    <li> 2 tsps. vegetable oil.</li>
                    <li>Pinch of salt.</li>
                </ul>
                <note>Note: All ingredients should be at room temperature and make sure that you have enough vegetable oil for deep frying</note>
            </li>
            <li>Preparation of Dough;
                <ul>
                    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and the sugar.</li>
                    <li>Mix the water and the vegetable oil. Gradually add this mixture to the flour while kneading into dough. Use additional water if necessary.</li>
                    <li>Knead for about fifteen to twenty minutes until a smooth and elastic dough is formed.</li>
                    <li>let dough rest for several minutes.</li>
                    <li>Divide the entire dough into six equal round balls.</li>
                    <li>Spread every ball onto a flat surface maintaining a circular shape of the dough.</li>
                    <li>Cut the flattened dough into four equal quadrants.</li>
                    <li>Repeat steps 6 and 7 until you spread and cut all the round balls.</li>
                    <li>Place all of the dough quadrants in a cookie sheet. This will prevent the dough pieces sticking onto each other.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Frying the Dough;
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat a few cups of vegetable oil to 400F - 500F in a skillet or deep pot.</li>
                    <li>Carefully put dough quadrants in the hot oil.</li>
                    <li>With Caution, turn the dough a few times until they are golden brown all over.</li>
                    <li>Fry only as many together as they can float in the oil without touching one another.</li>
                    <li>Once completely fried, take them out and place on a paper towel to drain.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Serving the Dish;
                <ul>
                    <li>Let it cool down and drain most of the oil off of the Mandazi.</li>
                    <li>Serve them on a plate with tea in the morning.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
